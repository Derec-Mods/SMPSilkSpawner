A balanced, vanilla-friendly alternative to the many overpowered or overly complex Silk Touch spawner plugins. Unlike other plugins that add flashy mechanics/GUI, strange custom items, or ignore game balance, Silk Touch Spawners keeps things simple, configurable, and in line with vanilla Minecraft’s feel. Spawner breaking can have both a risk/reward feel as well as restrictions on their usage

## Features

### Spawner Connection & Upgrades
- **Connect to Existing Spawners:** Placed spawners can only be connected to existing ones, preventing scattered overworld placement and encouraging clustered, strategic builds. *(Fully configurable and toggleable)*
- **Lag-Friendly Design:** Natural limitations via Minecraft’s mob spawner radius prevent excessive lag from large clusters.

### Breaking Spawners *(Fully configurable and toggleable)*
- **Silk Touch Requirement:** Spawners can only be mined with a Silk Touch pickaxe.
- **Drop Chance:** 50% chance to drop the spawner when mined.
- **Explosions on Break: (by default)**
    - 70% chance of a **small explosion**
    - 40% chance of a **large explosion**
    - 10% chance of a **massive explosion**
- **Durability Damage:** Pickaxes will lose a huge chunk of durability when attempting to mine a spawner*
- **Player Damage:** Breaking a spawner can be configured to damage the player (a soul for a soul)

### Configuration
Every mechanic is configurable in the plugin’s settings:
- Enable/disable spawner connection rules
- Adjust drop rates and explosion chances
- Modify which mob spawner types can be mined
- Set durability damage values
- Control explosion sizes and effects

## Use Cases
- Survival servers looking for balanced spawner mechanics.
- SMPs that want to encourage community mob farms over scattered solo setups.
- Economy servers that want spawner farming to carry risks and costs.

## Planned Improvements
- More advanced upgrade tiers for spawners.
- Customizable mob type conversion rules.
- Integration with popular economy and protection plugins.
- Upgrade Mechanics: If the placed spawner matches the mob type of the existing spawner, it can upgrade the existing spawner’s stats.
